# About Me

I’m **Mayank Bambal**, currently completing my MS in Business Analytics & Information Management at Purdue University (Aug 2025). With a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Indore, I’ve spent the past 4+ years driving data‐driven decisions in banking, analytics consulting, and financial services.  
 
- **Churn Reduction**: Led Random Forest + SHAP analysis on Databricks to cut customer churn by 5% YoY.  
- **Automation**: Built an end-to-end AWS A/B-testing pipeline, shrinking analysis time from 3 days to 4 hours.  
- **NLP & AI**: Deployed LLM-based pipelines for report parsing and Q&A, reducing manual QA by 30% and reporting time by 40%.  

I’m passionate about turning complex datasets into clear insights and scalable tools that drive business impact.
